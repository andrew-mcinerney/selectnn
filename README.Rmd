The goal of selectnn is to determine the optimal architecture when implementing
neural networks as a statistical model.
The function used to fit neural networks is `nnet` (Venables and Ripley,
2002).


## Installation

You can install the development version of selectnn from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("andrew-mcinerney/selectnn")
```


## Model Selection

The primary function in this package is `nn_select()`.
It is used to perform neural network model selection.
The approach is detailed in McInerney and Burke (2022).

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(selectnn)
nn_select(X, y, Q, n_init)
nn_select(y ~ ., data = df, Q, n_init)
```
